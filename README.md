Chris' Rocks

Chris' rocks is my HTML, CSS and Javascript project to showcase some rock samples from my personal collection. I've collected there rocks in many different locations from Goose Bay, Labrador, to a shop outside of Zion National Park in Utah, U.S.A. With this project, I want to showcase my background but also create an interactive visually appealing page. 

GIS Project

Ultimately I want to have a GIS based project displaying historic mineral exploration data for users to download. My GIS Project was an initial construction of my vision of this app. What I have built in this preliminary vision has some cool search functionality from a example JSON mining data. 

OCR Project

I will need some OCR funcitnality in my final app as the historic mineral explration data is within scanned (non-searchable) PDFs. This OCR project was intended to test out a popular OCR API called Tesseract. Tesseract extracts texts from images, and some sample images are provided for test usage. Any png or jpg formatted image is current accepted by this app. 

ArcGIS API

I am testing the ArcGIS API here. The ArcGIS API is a web-based GIS applcaiton where I can upload and plot data on a user-interacive 2D map. I have current mineral exploraiton claims and all recorded mineral showings in Newfoundalnd and Labrador uploaded for users to interact with. The ultimate vision of the app I want to build will require a GIS API. Please note that the claims and mineral showing data are accurate to Janurary 2nd, 2023.
